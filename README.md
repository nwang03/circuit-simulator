https://circuit-simulator.netlify.app/

This is a website meant for simulating the behavior of RC, RL, and LC circuit behavior through animations and graphing corresponding values in real time.
Hovering over each button gives a preview of the circuit diagram and animation.

After one of the options is selected, the user will be taken into a page with a diagram of the circuit they clicked along with an empty graph.
